 In Swift, when you define a static var, it's like putting a single shared variable in a common area that everyone(all threads) can access.
 But this can cause problems if multiple threads try to use or change it at the same time - leading to unexpected or incorrect behavior(called a data race).
 
 üß† Real-World Analogy: A Shared Whiteboard
 Imagine you work in a company office where:

 There is one whiteboard in a common meeting room.

 The whiteboard is used to track the number of employees hired.

 Whenever someone is hired, an HR person comes in and adds 1 to the number written on the board.

 ‚ùå What happens if there's no control?
 If 2 HR employees run into the room at the same time and both read "42" on the board:

 One decides to write "43"

 The other also decides to write "43"

 ‚ùå You just hired 2 people but the board only increased by 1!
 
 ‚úÖ How does DispatchQueue help?
 Now imagine the company adds a rule:

 Only one person is allowed into the room at a time to use the whiteboard.

 There's a guard at the door (this is your DispatchQueue).

 If HR person A is inside, HR person B has to wait outside.

 So the updates happen one at a time, in a safe and orderly way.

 That‚Äôs exactly what DispatchQueue.sync { ... } does:
 It ensures that only one thread at a time can access the critical code inside.
